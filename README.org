* Ideas
*** exact plan of where to use statistics to analyze data
*** have basic script to query bpf loader for interactions
*** figure out gathering statistics on bpf loader

regression so that i see how often a smart contract is called, correlated that with discrete solana eventsQQ
github accounts, see what other solana events they enter
see what other ecosystems they develop in
see how long they develop
see how many projs they develop




count how many progs deployed per day, check after event, and check that diff

intervention analysis, model impact of event (permanent effects), just do anova test




with github data, can do regression


can see productivity


how do i measure developoor activity: developer frequency
